### For City Employees
- **One-Time Registration**: Upon first-time login, employees register with the system. Subsequent logins are recognized automatically through Google.
- **Map Overview**: Upon login, employees see a city map highlighting areas with reported issues.
  - Issues are filtered based on the employee's specific field and expertise.

- **Issue Claiming**: Employees can claim tasks, indicating that they are responsible for resolving specific issues.
  - Once claimed, the issue becomes invisible to other employees in the same field.

- **Task Completion**: When a task is completed, the employee marks it as done, removing it from their task list and clearing it from the map.

### Project Benefits
